# Canonical recruitment task
My solution to the Canonical recruitment task. I tried to figure out a good compromise between modifying the look with custom CSS and using only Vanilla Framework classes. In the end it doesn't look exactly like in the screenshot, because I didn't want to modify too much the predefined framework's design.
